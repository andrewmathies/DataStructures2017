1. Well there is no advantage to choosing the right subtree over the left
subtree, it's just important to pick one side and be consistent. You can't
do anything except for pick either left or right and always have equal 
values on that sides subtree.

3. Pre-order - 15, 5, 7, 20, 18, 16, 25
   In-order - 5, 7, 15, 16, 18, 20, 25
   Post-order - 7, 5, 16, 18, 25, 20, 15

4. Not always, but often the smallest element will be in the leaf that has
the greatest depth of any node. This is because in a MaxHeap elements of
small value will always be displayed below elements of higher value. So
the smallest element will always be a leaf, but it will not always have the
greatest depth, it might be a leaf halfway down the heap if it was placed
fairly early in the process of building the heap.
