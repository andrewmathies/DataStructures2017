I solved Task A by creating a helper method to calculate the Hamming distance
of two characters, and then used that in a loop to go through two "strings of
dna" and find the total hamming distance. I solved Task C by going through 
the list of methods for a single array example in the book, converting them to
methods for 2D arrays, and then adding any I thought important. Then I wrote
those out as an interface, and then implemented that as cleanly as I could.
Then I made several test cases for my 2DArray methods to see if they worked
as I expected them to.
