To make the card thing I just copied the interface from the course website
and then added in a new method to draw a hand of cards. Then I made a new file
to implement the interface, the only part that was a little tricky was making
sure when I got a hand of cards that I never got duplicates and that the deck
had the same amount of cards afterwards as before. I don't know if there is a
better way to do that but I feel like there should be, it feels sloppy to just
stick stuff in another list and then copy it over afterwards. For the tweet
thing I just made a few examples and followed the instructions, it seemed
pretty barebones so I don't have much to say about it.
